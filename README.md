# D-core-G-lore-for-Minecraft
Various decorative blocks and other things for Minecraft.
"This mod is the first I will be making and pretty much my first time actually coding something functional or significant.
I hope to be making a mod for Minecraft which will add at least 200 new building/ visually appealing blocks, as well as other things if possible (wink wink, nudge nudge.
I Also am aiming for it to be extremely simple and not require too much effort to get started in.
Any assistance with bugs and/ or desires for new mechanics would be much apreciated."
